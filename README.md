# BooksMart

Android App to exchange Books

We as students face problems when it comes to finding books for every semester and we have to enquire in various libraries and shops and it also becomes difficult for people financially as the books are not cheap as well.
Along with that we have the environmental crisis as thousands of books are thrown away every year and tons of paper is wasted. Hence we have created a mobile application ‘Books ‘S’ Mart’ to connect the two: one who wants to give away the used book and one who is in dire need of it.
